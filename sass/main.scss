//The abstracts/ folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project.
//Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
@use "abstracts/functions";
@use "abstracts/mixins";
@use "abstracts/variables";

//The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project.
@use "base/base";
@use "base/animations";
@use "base/typography";
@use "base/utilities";

//For smaller components
@use "components/button";
@use "components/composition";
@use "components/feature-box";

//The layout/ folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application.
@use "layout/grid";
@use "layout/header";

//If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a pages/ folder, in a file named after the page.
@use "pages/home";
